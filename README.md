# Web Crawler Exercise
View on GitHub: <https://github.com/beroca/hello-web-crawler.git>

The aim of this test assignment is to write a program in Java which counts top Javascript libraries used in web pages found on Google.

## Prerequisites
Please create an easily compilable project (e.g. maven/gradle/Intellij/Eclipse project).
Please do not spend more than 3 hours on the task. We expect incomplete solutions - the task is designed that way.

The command-line program should do the following:
0. Read a string (search term) from standard input
1. Get a Google result page for the search term
2. Extract main result links from the page
3. Download the respective pages and extract the names of Javascript libraries used in them
4. Print top 5 most used libraries to standard output

### Bonus steps
- write tests or think about the approach for testing your code
- think about / implement Java concurrency utilities to speed up certain tasks
- think about / implement de-duplication algorithms for the same Javascript libraries with different names

### Notes
- use whatever approach you think is the best and most efficient, you donâ€™t need to create elaborate or complex parsing algorithms
- you can skip a step if it's too hard (and mock data for the next step)
- if something is not clear or can be done in multiple ways, describe why you chose your approach
- use a minimum of 3rd party libraries if possible, preferred is just JDK , however you can mention libraries with which a certain task would be more efficient and/or easier to write

# Proposed Solution

## Challenges and Design Choices

- Added PMD. A static Java source code analyzer.

- To keep JS-Lib ranked use SortedMap instead of Map

- Use of Google Web Search API (Deprecated).
- Use of Google Custom Search.
- Use of Java Standard Libraries

- Use of wget or curl
-- Google Search rejects programmatic access by default.
-- robots.txt of Google Search
-- Setting the right User Agent

- Encode invalid characters in the string used to build the search URL (e.g. spaces, punctuation, etc.).
- Use of `<h3>` tag versus "link:" attribute to find Google Search result links.

### Cardinality
Relationships between the 3 main entities relevant in the solution.
- URL, Javascript library, Ranking value.
- URL, Js-lib: 1-to-many.
- Js-lib, Raking value: many-to-1

The relationship between a ranking value and a Javascript library is "1-to-many".
That is, a given ranking value (1 occurrance, 2 occurrences, ..., n occurrencies), can have *many* Javascipt libraries.

Keeping the Js-libs always sorted or not.

### Approach 1
Using a Map and a Set.

`HashMap<String, Integer>`
- Map of (Library => Raking position)
- Order of keys, not relevant.
- Order of values, yes.

`SortedSet<Integer>`
- Set of all Ranking positions *in order*.
- Order of elements, relevant.

Iterating through the SortedSet and Iterating through the HashMap:
- For each element in the SortedSet (ranking value), all Js-Libs can be displayed.

It works but it requires O(n^2)

### Approach 2
Using 2 Maps.

`HaspMap<String, ArrayList<<String>>`
- Map of (Libraries => List of URLs where they appear). 
- Order of Libraries not needed.

`SortedMap<Integer, ArrayList<<String>>`
- Map of (Ranking positions => List of Libraries with that Ranking).
- Order of Libraries relevant!

### Improvements
- Test Driven Development
